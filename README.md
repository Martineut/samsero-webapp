My first website created using mostly claude AI and a minimal part was done by chatgpt
The code was put together me
Also hosting the website using an AWS EC2 Instance to practice my Ubuntu skills (Too much information for my hacker friends)
Also learnt that i could get a free subdomain name that could point to my public ip
Also added encryption to my webpage
